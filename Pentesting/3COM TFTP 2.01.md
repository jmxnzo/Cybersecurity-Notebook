1. Do fuzzing using a script to extend the payload by each step, to determine when we are overwriting the EIP -> if we overwrite the EIP with the "jmp to shellcode" function, we end up running our exploit without complications
2. Search for the return adress, which should be stored in the EIP in Immunity Debugger
``` Immunity-Debugger
find !mona jmp -r esi -m user32 --> \x4E\xAE\x45\x7E
```
3. Adapt the exploit in the way, that the return address is written at the right place:
		-> opcode + filename + 0 + payload + return adress(jmp statement)+0

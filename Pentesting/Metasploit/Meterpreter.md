- Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker can explore the target machine and execute code
- deployed using in-memory DLL injection
- resides entirely in memory and writes nothing to disk(no new processes, very limited forensic footprint)


- to circumvent the drawbacks of using specific payloads, while enabling the writing of commands and ensuring encrypted communication
-> no alarm triggering because of specific payloads


- uses a reverse_tcp shell, which means it connects to a listener on the attackerâ€™s machine

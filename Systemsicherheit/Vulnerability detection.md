1. Question: Heap based overflow
2. Question: Stack based
3. Question: Stack based and exploiting a interger underflow while using typecasting from int to unsigned in in memcpy()-function

Look up the links in the lecture about overflow:
https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/courses/cs380s_fall09/blexim.txt

- non-executable stack --> stack only, but just preventing inserted code, not already stored code on the system
- randomization of mem, depending on which buffers are modified, it can prevent both types of of

- canaries and shadow stack only prevent against stack based overflow
- run time checking helps both
- use libsafe and avoid use of dangerous function

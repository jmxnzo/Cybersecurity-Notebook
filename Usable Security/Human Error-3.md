1. Understand triggers and underlying causes of human error  
2. How we can prevent human error through design and  
organisational measures  
− learning from incidents and near misses  
− everyday problems



## 1. Understand triggers and underlying causes of human error  
What is Human Error?  
• When humans take incorrect actions, or execute intended actions incorrectly  
• One of the contributing factors in risk events  
• Problem: “one of the contributing” gets read as “the main” or  “the only” – it’s simple to blame somebody
→Making a system safe or secure means identifying and  
removing upstream failures.

- wie giftiger Cocktail und Hütchen
-> das System ist der bereits giftige Coktail und der Human Error ist letztendlich das Hütchen zu ausschmücken, aber nicht der Hauptgrund für den Angriff

active failures: errors and violations(human)
latent failures: already existing problems in the system, organisational and local workplace conditions

## Automatic execution, long-term based
• Around 90% of our actions
• Highly efficient
• Mix conscious goal-setting with automatic control
• Routines: reduces the conscious attention with which acts are
performed
• Errors:
1. ‘Absent-mindedness’
2. Resorting to familiar and common-place responses
in situations of stress or danger

automatisch ausgeführte Handlungsketten, wenn eine Tätigkeit frequentiell, oftmals ausgeführt wird 
->not 100% present, focussed while executing the task

## Conscious Execution
• Around 10% of our actions
• Need to pay full attention
• Slow, effortful, tiring
• Error-prone
• Flexible
neue Aufgaben, die noch nicht ausgeführt wurden 
->concious workspace, time inefficient, because a lot of attention is required for executing


## Switch to te "slow" lane
#### Pro
• Focusing attention
improves likelihood of
detecting
• Avoiding time pressure
reduce likelihood of errors

##### Con
• Time-consuming: cannot
do this for all tasks
• Are check advised doable
and effective?

→ Solution: “batching” suspicious emails and
working through them in “slow” mode

-> both systems have their disadvantages, so we can't generalize operating in System 1 or System 2 is better regarding security tasks
-> focusing so hard on security tasks is unrealistic and is not avoiding problems 100%, both operating systems serve their own problems


## Active failures
• Circumvention of security policies or measures
• Intentional, but the negative consequences (security breaches)
are not
• Underlying causes
− Not knowing/underestimating risk
− Erroneous beliefs (illusions)

### Triggers of error: individual factors
1. Lack of skills and knowledge
2. Attitude (e.g., risk taker)
3. Fatigue
4. Personal worries and issues


### Triggers of error: human factors
1. Human limitations (memory, attention) [[Human factors#3. Know human capabilities and limitations, and how they shape interaction with security]]
2. Habits -> e.g. use habits from home environment in the company
3. Assumptions -> humans tend to make assumptions which suit there expectations
4. Stress
5. Illusions
	1. Illusion of control (“I can handle it”)
	2. Illusion of invulnerability (“Nothing will happen to me”)
	3. Illusion of superiority (“I’m better than most”)
	4. Illusion of futility (“If it’s your turn, it’s your turn”)



### Triggers of error: task demands
- Über-. und Unterforderung führt zu Fehlern, beide Extreme sollten vermieden werden
1. High workload
2. Time pressure
3. Multiple tasks
4. Monotonous work/boredom
5. Unclear rules
6. Unclear goals and roles (responsibility)


### Triggers of error: work environment
1. Poor equipment
2. Changes in routine, rules and procedures
(old ones are strongest)
3. Unclear displays/controls/messages
4. Interruptions


-> changing routine behaviour is really hard, because forgetting is hard
-> in work environment change the events of the routines, because just trying to change the bad behaviour doesn't work (reflect on the event, which is initializing the bad behaviour and remove it)



## Learning from errors
all companies with good security place examples, on how to learn from security errors
• Incidents and near misses reveal latent and active failures
• Identifying them (and potential root causes) provides route to improving organizational security
• Requires organization is willing to learn, rather than just blame someone and look for quick fixes


### Error culture
• Instinctive human response is to hide errors, for fear of being
blamed
• Encourage reporting of problems and issues before an incident
occurs
• Requires
− “no blame culture”
− knowing where to report
− visible actions being taken
− trust [[Trust]] 


## Summary
1. Understanding why people make mistakes reveals that blaming individuals will not improve security.
2. We need to identify underlying causes of mistakes - active and latent failures, and remove them.
3. Incidents and near misses are opportunities to find and remove active and latent failures – but so are everyday problems.
4. Every policy that cannot be followed in practice is a vulnerability –encourage reporting so these can be fixed!
5. Requires building an error culture an no blame reporting

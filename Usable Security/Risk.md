Definition:
•Exposure bezeichnet grundsätzlich **die Tatsache, einem Risiko ausgesetzt zu sein** --> Ausgesetztsein
• Asset: What we want to protect  
• Threat: Harm that can happen to an asset  
• Attack: A threatening event  
• Attacker: The agent causing an attack (not necessarily human)  
• Vulnerability: A weakness in the system that makes an attack  
more likely to succeed  
• Risk: A quantified measure of the likelihood of a threat being realised  
• Impact: A measure of the seriousness of a threat
- deterrence: Abschreckung, Widerstand

connection between threat and vulnerability -> the threat describes the harm that can happen to an asset, without regarding if a vulnerability is existing(kind of: the vulnerability opens a threat, but in risk analysis the only possibility is to identify possible threats first and then focus on vulnerabilities that can used to exploit the thread)

### What is risk?
1. Exposure to the possibility of an adverse event - loss, injury, security breach.  
2. All risk is perceived.  
3. Some risk is visible, some is hidden.  
4. Some risk can be quantified, some only estimated.

Risk Analysis beschreibt das Betrachten unserer Assets und mögliche Threats und Vulnerabilities in unserem System. Nachdem die Risk Analysis durchgeführt wurde, lässt sich im Risk Management anhand von selbst-definierten Security Measures dass Risiko verwalten und den Bedürfnissen nach anpassen.


### Outcome of risk analysis (documented in a risk register)
1. Identification of all assets (rating of importance and business)
2. Identification of threats (likelihood of them)-> not all threats and vulnerabilities will be known
	1. Assessment of the proximity(Nähe/Lage) of a threat (temporal or physical proximity) -> when and where might a threat occur?
3. Identification of vulnerabilities

### Risk register
- risk analysis output of a large and complex system -> large and difficult to manage
- risk register serves as a tool for making the output manageable and reusable
			- includes:  risk type and severity
			- owner of risk
			- possible courses of action, both anticipation/prevention and response 
			- residual risk(rest/andere)


### risk analysis
traditional ra starts with identification and valuation of key assets, but every company or organisation has individual critical processes 
That's why:
1. identify critical processes
2. prioritise assets needed for those processes
3. revise impact valuation of these assets
	-> The criticality of a process may increase the impact valuation of one or more assets identified

### impact valuation
- identification and valuation of threats
- for each group of assets: 
	- identify threats for stored data: loss of availability, confidentiality, integrity, completeness
	--> for many asset typed, the key threat is loss of availability
- assess impact of threat H-M-L or 1-10

### Identification and assessment of vulnerabilities
1. Identify vulnerabilities  
− How to exploit a threat successfully  
2. Assess levels of likelihood of attempt - High, Medium, Low  
− Expensive attacks are less likely (e.g., brute-force attacks on  
encryption keys)  
− Successful exploitation of vulnerability  
3. Combine them

### possible responses to risk
1. Avoid it completely (by withdrawing from the activity)  
2. Accept it (and do nothing)  
3. Reduce it with security measures  
	− Prevention  
	− Detection  
	− Reaction/recovery  
	− Insurance (for high impact, low likelihood events)


• Countermeasures reduce risks, but may also introduce new ones: 
for example: – hardening cockpit doors enables rogue pilots  
– log files for audit can reveal  information, attackers can subvert  alarm and automatic shut-down  mechanisms  
• These need to be added to risk analysis and managed


### Human and risk

• Humans vary in their risk propensity(Neigung): partly personal disposition, but mostly influenced by  
− the perception of risk  
− the potential rewards of taking risks  
− the experience of losses – one’s own and others  
• Individual decision to take risk: perception of risk weighed against the propensity to take risk


• Humans differ in how much risk they are prepared to take, but  
1. older  people are more risk-averse than younger people  
2. Risk tolerance for others they care about is lower than for their own person (e.g., parents for children)

### Risk compensation
- when a measure is introduced to reduce (likelihood, impact of) a risk, humans risk-taking behaviour may increase



### Human behaviour around risk
• Risks can be emotionally processed  
	− Linked to automatic risk judgements  
	− Not consciously experienced  
	− “System 1” thinking, so fast and intuitive  

• Consciously thinking about risk:  
	− “System 2” thinking, so slower  
	− More effortful  
	− Analytical, more likely to notice details

### risk biases in humans
1. over-estimate recent, "close" and "similar" risk, and underestimate others
2. Easily recalled & vivid events are likely to evoke the availability heuristic which increases risk perception
3. common and familiar risks are underestimated or ignored


example for risk biases in humans: Governments tend to spend far more, in terms of cost per life saved, on ‘dread’-type risks (e.g., exposure to arsenic) {-> emotionally processed} than on  
the mundane (e.g., road traffic incidents) {-> common and familiar risks are underestimated}

### illusions of certainty
1. The Zero-Risk Illusion:  
– Known risks mistaken for absolute certainty  
– Belief that security measures are infallible  
– “It won’t happen to me” syndrome  
2. Calculable Risk Illusion:  
– Risk calculation is based on the assumption of known risks  
in an uncertain environment  
– Precise numbers for uncertain risk lead to illusory certainty


### problematic risk management behaviors
1. human perception of low risk + uncertainty = no risk
2. when risk-taking is rewarded (nothing happened) risk-taking increases
3. Preference easily understandable risks: preference for managing risks we understand and how to manage, avoiding uncertain risks 


Security measures introduced to increase perceived security only 
1. Re-assure people who don’t know better  
2. Deter attackers who don’t know better  
3. Economics: because regulator demands it, or insurance  
company give you a discount

• Probably not  
1. Or maybe – as long as you don’t forget it is not effective  
2. Still consumes resources  
3. What makes financial sense for insurance company does  
not necessarily make sense for your company


### Summary
1. Human behaviour with risks is influenced by the perception  of risks and subject to biases.  
2. This behaviour can be influenced through communication, design and training.

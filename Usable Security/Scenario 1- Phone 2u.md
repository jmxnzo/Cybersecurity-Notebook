Human capabilities and limitations (call center):

capabilities:
physically
- ability to do a phone call and motor skill to fulfill the task
perceptive

cognitive

limitations:
physically 
- loud, noisy surrounding at the call center
perceptive
- humans are bad at detecting signals, which are small incremental changes, so different telephone number can maybe not be recognized
cognitive
- Attention: - they need to focus on two different task at same time, check data on the computer and do the phone call at the same time
- Decision-making: subject to biases



### Active failures human error in the call center

individual factors: 
- lack of skills and knowledge, because they only work in the call center for short time
- attitude it's not their dreamjob, so they won't be too motivated
- fatigue, because they work really hard
- 
human factors:
- human limitations  point 1
- habits: maybe bad habits of just giving out the passwort via phone call to a user 
- assumptions: humans tend to make assumptions which suit there expectations: so they will just help out
- Stress

task demands:
- high workload, time pressure, multiple tasks
- monotonous work
- maybe haven't been introduced to the work, so unclear rules

work environment:
- unclear controls via computer system to check for the client information


## Trust in the call center
- Vertrauen ist auch hier ein short-cut, der es einem Mitarbeiter ermöglicht ökonomischen benefit zu erzielen, in dem er einfach die credentials rausgibt und sich dem nächsten Call widmet

### Social engineering attack on call center via Vishing


reziprok=gegenseitig, wechselhaft

## Phishing attack
- a fake ’pre-registration site’ for the tickets
- senden von Massen-Phishing Emails zu potentiellen Nutzer von Phone2U oder durch einen Databreach, an die Adressen gekommen
- strategies: 
	- social proof: auf der Website angeben, dass es schon viele glückliche Käufer der Festivaltickets gab
	- scarcity(resources, time): alle Tickets seien bald ausverkauft, deshalb muss man nun schnell pre-registrieren
	- reciprocity: anzeigen der Vorteile die dadurch entstehen und bewerben des Tickets, das
	 - liking: der tolle Künstler X wird zum Festival kommen


## Crime prevention aus Conjunction of criminal opportunities model
- easy wider environment for hacking and as well crime resources :spoofing is pretty easy, only password confirmation and all done only
- no crime preventers, also required in the context of appearing social media problems
- crime promoter in the hacking forum
- hackers goal is just financial wise -> low risk and effort but high reward -> also opportunists can take the chance to do mimicry attacks




Brianne Leader:
- primary task:
	- just use the Phone2U App and share stuff about festivals 
	- post pictures
	- read comments
- secondary task:
	- securing account privacy
	- choose well passwords and maybe store them in a password manager
	- avoid being scammed by the ticket attackers

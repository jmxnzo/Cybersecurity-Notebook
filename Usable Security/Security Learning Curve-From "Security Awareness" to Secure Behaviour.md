Definitions:
1. Security Awareness  
	− make people realise they may be at risk  
	− render them amenable(zugänglich) to change  
		- Catch people’s attention, persuade them to engage, often by using principles from advertising
2. Security Education  
	− provision of security knowledge: e.g., which threats exist, how they enable risks, which countermeasures stop to use 
		+Increase people’s knowledge of threats and countermeasures  
		+Problems with current materials  
			− Untargeted = not relevant, know already  
			− Scary and negative (don’t don’t don’t)  
			− Not unified (Reeder et al. 2016) = high cognitive workload
		
− Maybe: change perceptions and attitudes to security

3. Security Training  
	− acquire security skills, establish secure behaviours
		- e.g., spot a phishing mail, configure privacy settings, encrypt your email  
		- Needs practice, feedback (confirmation or correction) and  coaching  
		- Sometimes incorporated in online training packages, but often more effective in small groups
		



### Security awareness
#### Methods:
- Posters, trinkets, banners as reminder: after a while they will be ignored
- narrative approaches: The natural antidote to uncertainty-based fear is clear communication 
- described in technical terms –-> into business risk 
- lack of coherence of security experts(different advice by everyone) --> there is no possible security tips list which will secure all threats --> security is individual for everyone
-->awareness techniques should be creative and frequently changed


### Positive motivating factors
1. (Vicarious{stellvertretend}) experience of threat  
2. Visible enforcement of policies  
3. Avoiding personal embarrassment  
4. Protecting others (people, organisation)  
5. Respect for others - role models  
6. Professional standards (shared norms)



security training and especially the used evaluation criteria is often not serving the needs  for companies

## Behavior Model Fogg

Motivation and ability work together like teammates. The amount you have of one affects the amount you need of the other. The harder a behaviour is to do, the less likely you are to do it. You need serious motivation to do something difficult.

- The more motivated you are to do a behaviour, the more likely you are to do the behaviour.  
- When motivation is high, people not only take action when prompted

#### problems to face
• High motivation creates initial enthusiasm, but is difficult to sustain – motivation surge, followed by a crash, or peters out ...  
• This is especially the case for secondary tasks like security – individual’s focus quickly shifts back to primary task

#### embedding the behaviour is crucial
• behaviour needs to be embedded to become automatic  
• Repeating the message is not enough... the behaviour needs  
to be repeated  
”Studies also suggest that humans forget approximately 50% of  
new information within an hour of learning it, and 70% within 24  
hours. This reinforces the need to frequently deliver and repeat  
security messages, education and training.” ISF


## example prompt in context
• Cueing past negative experiences motivate some people, but put off others  
--> ***Trust (perceived motivation)*** in those giving advice is key (add-on purchases?)
--> if you want people to do something, make it easy


### Nudges
Nudges are security notifications, messages, and prompts designed to influence specific security behaviors. They steer people toward the right security decision—when it matters most.

A nudge could be a prompt at the end of the working day, prompting a software update. Or it could be a reminder to complete the latest security awareness training module. It’s personalized. It’s relevant. It gets people to do the right thing, at the right time.

sending security information is like showing a map months before a trip, while nudging is like a sat nav, which tells when to take action, turn and what matters most

#### key principles nudges
• Transparent & truthful: should be transparent and never misleading  
• True choice: easy to opt out of default  
• Beneficial: Influences individual in a way that will make chooser better off, as judged by themselves!!!

### other problems
- most organisations run security awareness programs to comply with external requirements. And think what they want is for employees to comply. But:
	- Adherence(compliance) makes people not follow the plans 
	- Concordance (active participation) instead works really good, so you need to give employees an oppurtunity to commit to the goal(WHAT) and a viable way getting there (HOW)

### Self-efficacy
- humans need to believe they can do something 
- was a reliable, moderately strong predictor of cyber-security  
intention and behaviour.  
This suggests that interventions that seek to improve users’ ability to  respond appropriately to cyber-threats (and belief that those responses will be effective) is more likely to yield positive results than campaigns based around stressing the threat

1. Mastery Experience: Positive direct experience builds up self-beliefs, failure undermines  
2. Vicarious Experience: Observing success of other people (especially  trusted ones) being successful building up self-beliefs  
3. Verbal Persuasive Efficacy: Influential people may impact self-efficacy convince us that we can master activities or convince us to spend the effort  
4. Emotional and Physiological States: Stress often interpreted as vulnerability, positive emotions as indicator for confidence



“The trouble with habits is that they are hard to get rid of.  
If you get rid of the ‘h’ you still have abit.  
If you get rid of the ‘a’ you still have a bit.  
If you get rid of the ‘b’ you still have it.”

### Intentional forgetting
We are able to push memories out of our minds by changing the  
mental representations of contextual information associated  
with the event
### Replace the cues
Retrieval cues that are not (any longer) available play a central role in forgetting. If retrieval cues activate memory items with the highest retrieval strength, a strong variation of cues (also including the actors involved) leads to the fact that memory items to perform routines are no longer activated, are suppressed, and new and desired actions are performed instead.
- security examples: new password rules, encrypted vs. unencrypted USB sticks
• Organisations often just demand people change behaviour ... especially in security  
• Not going to happen!  
• Need to invest in

### Reactance
• “Blind resistance" to change  
• Results when individuals  
1. don't agree with goals  
2. are cast in a role of passive compliance  
3. don't trust those who make/enforce the rules  
4. the rules don't make sense for them

### Summary  
1. Security awareness, education, training can’t fix security measures that don’t work in practice.  
2. Quality of content and communication of security advice currently low.  
3. Single-shot interventions won’t change security behaviour –  
	removing and building habits takes time and effort, organization needs to support  
4. Re-inforcing messages through multiple channels can work,  especially if embedded in relevant context.

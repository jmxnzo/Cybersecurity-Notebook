## Aims of this lecture
1. To know the about the types of attacks that target humans.
2. To know about different types of attackers and their
characteristics.
3. How we can apply this in the design/selection of
countermeasures.
4. … to be continued in next lecture, with crime science model.


## Attack surface
- is increasing with the digitalisation and financial interest in digital systems
- today attacks target everything: humans, technology, business, partners
- reason of system failure: complexity of systems and mimicry(Nachahmungs) attacks are easy


## different attacks on the human element
• Capture attacks: stealing
• Observation attacks: e.g., shoulder-surfing
• Social engineering: phishing, pretexting, 419 and romance
scams
• Doxing: systematic collection of user credentials & data to use
in attacks
• Coercion attacks: e.g., ransomware, blackmail


## why understand attackers?
• Attackers are people, too – and they look for the easy way, have
habits, and make mistakes (Human Error)
• They differ in
	− Ability
	− Resources
	− Motivation
	− Risk propensity(Risikoneigung) 
• Defence can be made more (cost)effective by taking these
characteristics into account


# Categories of attackers
1. Opportunists
2. Pawns
3. Emotional attackers
4. Insiders, and their friends and relations
5. Professionals, organised cyber crime
6. Terrorists
7. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

### Opportunists
• Aim: greed, advancement
• Most common types of attacker: 80% of humans might exploit
an opportunity if they think they can get away with it
• Skill level: low, spot and seize an “opportunity”, rather than
plan ahead
• Risk tolerance: low, will only proceed if convinced they will not
be caught
• Deterred by visible countermeasures and enforcement



## Pawns
• Aim: pleasing others, hope of advancement
• small cog in the big machine, used knowingly or unknowingly
professional attackers, terrorists or APT – e.g., money mules,
”work from home” scam victims
• Skill level: low
• Risk tolerance: high (because often unaware)
• Often not aware of countermeasures, or may have been
instructed how to avoid them

### Anzeichen von einem internen Attacker
1. Preparatory behaviour: multi-stage evidence gathering
2. Deliberate Markers: “I was here” to test detection/response
3. Meaningful errors: attackers are humans and make errors,
check error logs!
4. Correlated Usage Patterns: same probes/searches across
different systems
5. Verbal behaviour: dissatisfaction, threats

## factors of facilitating insides attacks
1. Insufficient screening during recruitment: happens
particularly when short of staff
2. Concealment of attacks: organisations let insiders “go
quietly”: for fear of damage to reputation
3. Allowing “Star players” to break or bend security policies
4. Lack of monitoring and/or visible enforcement of security
policies
5. Vulnerable processes: no separation of duties, “4 eyes”,
checks and balances


### preventing insides attacks
• Constant monitoring to detect rare events is inefficient
• Most effective when targeted, to get evidence/proof
(e.g., when pre-cursors indicate that employee might be
attacker)
• Consider impact on human resources and trust: constant
monitoring disliked by employees (even honest ones), (working
climate, social capital)
• The most devastating attacks today involve rogue executives
– Sayles & Smith (2005



# Social Engineering
- is any act that influences a person to take
an action that may or not may be in his or her best interest“
-  Examples: phishing, vishing, smishing, pretexting, romance
scams


1. OSINT (Open Source INtelligence) & d0xing
− Technical and non-technical
− Iteratively include gained information
− Search for contacts and relatives
− Use everything
2. Pretext
− Present oneself as someone else
3. Attack plan
4. Attack launch

### ways to influence
1. reciprocity (Gegenseitigkeit, Austausch)
2. obligation
3. concession (Entgegenkommen,Zugeständnis)
4. scarcity (Knappheit Zeit, Resourcen)
5. authority
6. consistency & commitment
7. liking
8. social proof

### human vulnerabilities
1. Distraction
2. Social Compliance (gellsch. Konformität, Normen, Werte)
3. Herd behaviour
4. Dishonesty
5. Deception
6. Need and Greed
7. Time


## security measures
1. don't focus on technical effectiveness, in case of overall effectiveness
2. security measures shouldn't be too complex or too many --> increase cost of defence
3. interaction with other organisational goals (productivity and other secondary goals)
4.  risk assessment of security measures




### Summary attacks and attackers
1. attack surface and the range of attacks is increasing
2. security measures need to be effective and efficient -> effective defense
3. knowing attackers(who) and why, can help to target security measures
	- put their wants outside of the range of skills and resources
	- increase specific attack cost(most attackers will only invest 10% of expected gain)
	- pick security measures that exceed their risk tolerance

- **nft_set (Netfilter Table Set):**
    
    - An nft_set is a data structure in nf_tables that holds a collection of elements. These elements can be IP addresses, port numbers, or other network-related information.
    - Sets are used to organize and store specific groups of data, typically enhancing the efficiency of firewall rules and other network configurations.
    - An nft_set can be thought of as a list of unique elements that can be referenced by nf_tables rules.
- **nft_rule (Netfilter Table Rule):**
    
    - An nft_rule represents an individual rule within an nf_tables table. This rule defines how network traffic should be treated.
    - Rules in nf_tables are organized within tables, and each rule is defined based on specific criteria (e.g., source IP, destination IP, port).
    - The nft_rule specifies what should happen to the network traffic that matches the criteria set in that rule.
- **Lookup Expression:**
    
    - The "lookup expression" is a component of the nf_tables rule language that allows access to an nft_set and searching for a specific value.
    - This expression enables a rule to process network traffic based on the contents of an nft_set. For example, a rule could be created to block traffic if the source IP address is contained in a specific nft_set.
    - The lookup expression facilitates dynamic linking of rules with sets, providing flexibility in configuring firewalls and network routines

    - An nft_set is a data structure that holds a collection of elements. These elements can be IP addresses, port numbers, or other network-related information.
2. **nft_rule (Netfilter Table Rule):**
    
    - An nft_rule represents an individual rule within an nf_tables table. This rule defines how network traffic meeting specific criteria should be handled.
3. **Criteria in nft_rule based on nft_set:**
    
    - The criteria specified in an nft_rule often involve conditions based on the contents of nft_sets. For example, a rule might specify that network traffic should be accepted or blocked based on whether the source IP address is present in a particular nft_set.
4. **Lookup Expression:**
    
    - The lookup expression is commonly used in nf_tables rules to refer to and examine the contents of nft_sets. It allows rules to dynamically inspect the elements within a set and make decisions based on that information.



- Anonymous sets are those that are:

- Bound to a rule, if the rule is removed, that set is released too.
- They have no specific name, the kernel internally allocates an identifier.
- They cannot be updated. So you cannot add and delete elements from it once it is bound to a rule.

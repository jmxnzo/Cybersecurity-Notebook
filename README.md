# Cybersecurity-Notebook
This repository is a collection of all my note-taking since summer 2023 during studying cybersecurity at different universities. It documents a lot of my journey and might be helpful for others as well. 

I do all my documentation in obsidian([https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)). For the easiest reading experience, just open the github repo in your obsidian vault.
Enjoy!!

- Implementation Goal: Low-cost/low resources
- Strategies to reduce implementation cost
	- S-Box instances (as largest element)
		- Reduce number of instances in hardware
		- Reduce the implementation cost per S-Box
	- Reduce the data path width
		- (128 bit à 32 bit à 8-bit à 1-bit)
	- Reduce number of register stages

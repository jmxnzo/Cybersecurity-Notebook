- It follows that we need at least three shares in order to implement a nonlinear function.

### Pipelining
- speed up of hardware implementations
- in order to allow large clock frequencies-> circuits should not be too deep
- technique where a logical circuit with l levels is divided into two circuits with l/2 levels, separated by a register, which stores the intermediate result of the first stage
- register is insensible to glitches 
- When considered individually, each of the pipeline stages represents a mathematical function that is less complex than the full circuit: the nonlinear degree will be lower and/or the number of monomials that needs to be summed. This will typically reduced the required number of shares and gates.
- Theorem 4 does not  cover resistance against higher moments


-> for AES the approach is quite difficult if no new randomness is added into the shares

**ISO 27001:**
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for Information Security Management. This norm establishes requirements for a comprehensive Information Security Management System (ISMS) aimed at ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. The focus is on identifying risks and implementing security controls to manage these risks.

**ISO 22301:**
ISO 22301 is an international standard for Business Continuity Management (BCM). This norm sets forth requirements for a comprehensive Business Continuity Management System to prepare organizations for unexpected disruptions and ensure that they can maintain their business-critical functions even in times of crises or disasters.

Both standards were revised in 2012 and 2018 to ensure they align with current requirements and developments. Each revision typically brings clarifications, updates, and adjustments to adapt to the changing environment.

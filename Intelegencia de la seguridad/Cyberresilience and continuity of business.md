### Difference cybersecurity and cyberresilience
• **Cybersecurity:** It involves a set of computer technologies and preventive measures designed to:
- protect the company against any security breach, whether it be data theft or unauthorized access to the corporate network(for example, data encryption)

• **Cyber Resilience:** This concept combines **cybersecurity** technology with **business resilience** to manage a cyber attack without failures.
- Above all, to provide business continuity in the face of an attack.
- ability of a system to recover from a failure and maintain persistent service reliability when facing faults
- goal is to ensure protection of business operations 
- capacity of an organization to withstand and adopt to and recover from adverse events
--> Cyber resilience involves not only the implementation of security measures, as in cybersecurity, but also the ability to recover and plan to mitigate impacts, ensuring operational continuity. 


### Why is cyberresilience important these days?
- often traditional security measures seem to be not sufficient, so it's reasonable to asume that attackers will eventually gain system access


### Beneficios de la Resiliencia
1. Mejora de la seguridad del sistema
	- helps in responding to an attack and surviving quickly
	- can be integrated in already existing infrastructure

2. Reducción de pérdidas financieras
	- ninguna entidad es inmune a los ataques cibernéticos
3. Cumplimiento de requisitos reglamentarios y legales
	- como la directiva de Redes y Sistemas de Información (NIS)
	- The abbreviation "NIS" commonly refers to the "Network and Information Systems." In the context provided, it specifically mentions the "NIS Directive." The NIS Directive is a European Union (EU) directive that focuses on enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of member states. It establishes cybersecurity and incident reporting obligations for operators of essential services (such as those in the energy, transportation, healthcare, and financial sectors) and digital service providers.
	- The directive aims to improve the cybersecurity resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services across the EU by setting forth requirements for risk management, incident reporting, and cooperation between member states. It plays a role in promoting a higher level of cybersecurity preparedness and response capabilities to protect against cyber threats and attacks.
4. Mejora de la cultura laboral y el proceso interno (Improvement of Work Culture and Internal Processes)
	- El objetivo de cada empleado de cualquier organización debe ser la seguridad de los datos y otras infraestructuras de TI.
	- When individuals are inspired to take security seriously within their organization, it is more likely that confidential information and physical assets will be in good hands.
5. Proteger la reputación 
	- Si una organización no tiene ciberresiliencia, el daño causado por los ciberdelincuentes es difícil de controlar.
6. Mantener la confianza de proveedores y clientes
	- It is essential to have cyber resilience to maintain the trust of suppliers and the public that an organization took many years to build. If an organization has an ineffective approach to cyber resilience, it can experience serious damage, including restitution to suppliers and customers whose confidentiality has been violated.
7. Mejora del equipo de TIC

contingencies(contingencias)=a future event or circumstance which is possible but cannot be predicted with certainty.
### Ventajas de las empresa ciberresilientes
1. Ventaja competitiva
2. Reducción del impacto económico de la interrupción del negocio
3. Gestión de riesgos mejorada
	- enabling the organization to develop greater proactivity in addressing risks, vulnerabilities and contingencies.



## Caracteristicas de una empresa ciber resiliente
- Respuesta adaptativa
- Monitorización analítica
- Protección coordinada -> require que un adversario supere(overcome) múltiples salvaguardas(safeguards)
- Diversidad -> limiting the loss of critical functions, by having replicated common components in place
- Posicionamiento dinámico -> Impedir la capacidad de un adversario para localizar, eliminar o corromper la misión o los activos comerciales



### Challenges
**Key Challenges in Achieving Cyber Resilience:**

1. **Skills Shortage:**
    
    - Difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified cybersecurity personnel.
    - Anticipated shortage of 3.5 million cybersecurity positions by 2024.
    - _Role of CISO:_ In charge of recruitment, talent management, and continuous skills development for cybersecurity professionals. They play a crucial role in addressing the workforce challenges.
2. **Lack of Inventory of Critical Data and Systems:**
    
    - Cyber resilience requires identifying and prioritizing critical data, endpoints, and systems.
    - Security professionals face challenges due to a lack of visibility into applications and data assets
3. **Technological Advances and Challenges:**

    - Constant shifts in the digital environment due to technological advancements create challenges in managing and securing security.
    

These challenges highlight the importance of addressing skill gaps, enhancing visibility into critical assets, and adapting to the evolving technological landscape for effective cyber resilience.


### How to implement cyberresilience?
**How to Implement Cyber Resilience:**

1. **Prioritize Services:**
   - Evaluate services based on the impact (economic, environmental, public and social, affected individuals) that their loss or deterioration may cause.
   - Prioritize services according to their importance for continuity.

2. **Understand and Prioritize Threats:**
   - Identify and prioritize threats affecting services based on their criticality.
   - Establish a clear understanding of the critical threats.

3. **Implement Preventive Actions:**
   - Implement preventive actions against current and future threats.
   - Adopt measures and technologies to prevent potential risks.

4. **Develop measurement processes:**
   - Develop measurement processes to minimize the damage incidents can cause.
   - Define protocols for responding to and mitigating incidents effectively.

5. **Continuous Vulnerability Detection:**
   - Continuously detect vulnerabilities and actively remediate them to reduce the attack surface.
   - Regularly assess systems to ensure a proactive approach to security.

6. **Establish and Maintain Communication Processes:**
   - Develop and maintain effective communication processes within the organization.
   - Ensure swift and efficient communication during incidents.

7. **Execute Continuous Improvement Actions:**
   - Consistently carry out improvement actions to minimize risks.
   - Repeat the cycle of steps for continuous enhancement.

Implementing cyber resilience involves a systematic approach that encompasses prioritization, prevention, measurement, continuous vulnerability detection, communication, and ongoing improvement efforts.


### **How to Measure Resilience:**

• The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has published the report "Key Challenges and Recommendations on Resilience Metrics for Networks and Services."

• ENISA's research indicates that:

- There are very few existing frameworks, and none are globally accepted.
- There are no standard practices, as organizations use different sets of metrics and reference frameworks.
- Combining or aggregating various frameworks into a high-level assessment is challenging.

• The recommendations provided are:

- Establish a common understanding and best practices or standards for resilience metrics (classification(taxonomy), description, and set of reference metrics, impact factors).
- Conduct further research on open issues in resilience metrics (aggregation, composition, thresholds, data analysis).
- Develop tools and software to automate the deployment of resilience measurements and to collect and analyze data.
- Promote best practices and information exchange

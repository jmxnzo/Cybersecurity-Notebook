### Direct Programming Interface DPI

- DPI-C allows C/C++ functions to be called from Verilog
- DPI-S allows Verilog functions to be invoked from C/C++


##### Important key parameter
- data type mapping
- proper synchronization and communication mechanisms
- input, output handling
- debugging 
- divide program functionality in different parts and examine which parts may be performed better using hardware or software modules -> energy consumption??

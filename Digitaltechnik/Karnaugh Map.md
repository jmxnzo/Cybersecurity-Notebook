## Karnaugh Map of sum of products in Karnaugh Map of product of sums umwandeln
1) alle leeren Felder einer karnaugh Map stellen das Komplement !(f) dar und nach dem DeMorgan Theorem kennzeichnen diese genau die product of sums der Funktion f

## Don´t cares
– Sometimes, we simply do not care what value is assumed by the function for certain combinations of input variables. – It may happen that we know that certain combinations of the variables will simply never occur. In this case, we also do not care about the output.

##  From two boolean functions to circuit
Given two functions 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 of the same input variables 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, and 𝑑, design the minimum-cost implementation.
1. draw the Karnaugh Map of both boolean functions and read the sum of products 
2. use the sum of products to draw the circuit


## From circuit to boolean expressions

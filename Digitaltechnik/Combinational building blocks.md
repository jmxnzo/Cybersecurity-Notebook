Definition:
Synthesis of circuit is defined as **a process of generating netlist from a circuit design model**. Synthesis means 'to generate'. It is a step to generate circuit hardware schematics. VLSI design flow is revisited here (Figure 11.1), explaining the role of synthesis in digital design flow.

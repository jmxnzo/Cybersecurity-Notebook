"Auditoría" and "control interno" are related concepts in the field of accounting and business management, but they refer to different aspects of ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of financial information and business operations.

1. **Auditoría (Audit):**
   - **Definition:** Auditoría, or audit, is a systematic examination of financial statements, records, operations, and processes to assess their accuracy, legality, and adherence to established standards.
   - **Purpose:** The primary purpose of an audit is to provide an independent and objective evaluation of an organization's financial information. This can include examining financial statements, internal controls, and compliance with regulations.

2. **Control Interno (Internal Control):**
   - **Definition:** Control interno, or internal control, refers to the policies, procedures, and mechanisms that an organization implements to safeguard its assets, ensure the accuracy of financial information, and promote operational efficiency.
   - **Purpose:** Internal control is designed to manage and mitigate risks within an organization. It includes processes for financial reporting, compliance with laws and regulations, and operational efficiency. Internal control is a proactive approach to preventing errors and fraud.

**Differences:**
   - **Focus:** Auditoría focuses on the examination and verification of financial information and processes after they have occurred. Control interno, on the other hand, is a set of measures and practices implemented within an organization to prevent errors and ensure ongoing compliance and efficiency.
   - **Timing:** Auditoría is typically conducted periodically, often annually, to provide an independent assessment. Control interno is an ongoing and continuous process integrated into daily operations.
   - **Independence:** Auditoría is often performed by external auditors who are independent of the organization. Control interno is established and maintained internally by the organization itself.

In summary, while auditoría involves the examination of financial information for accuracy and compliance, control interno is the system of internal checks and measures designed to prevent errors and ensure ongoing compliance and efficiency within an organization.

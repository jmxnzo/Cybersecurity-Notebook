Auditing is a detailed analysis of a system that allows for the discovery, identification, and correction of vulnerabilities in the assets it comprises and the processes it undergoes. Its purpose is to verify that the objectives of the organization's security policy are met. It provides a real and up-to-date picture of the security state of a system.

**Auditing:**
- It is important to collect a secure record of activities that can be used to verify compliance with desired security policies, trace violations of these policies, and detect anomalous patterns.
  - Secure record includes:
    - Detection
    - Traceability
    - Accountability, Non-repudiation
- There is no security without auditing.

**Key Points:**
- Auditing provides feedback in the security cycle.
- It is bad if information is stolen, but it is worse not to be aware of it.
- If a security failure occurs, it is important to know how it happened.
- If an attack goes undetected, an appropriate response to the incident cannot be provided.
- There is no security without auditing.

**Considerations:**
- Choosing the location of logs is important. Depending on the logs in which activity is recorded, different user groups may have access to them.
- Log size is also an important consideration. Decisions need to be made on how backups of logs will be stored and how often.


2. **Traceability:**
   - **Meaning:** Traceability involves the capability to track and follow the sequence of events or actions over time.
   - **Explanation:** A secure record with traceability enables the tracing of activities back to their source or origin. It provides a chronological trail, helping investigators understand how a security incident unfolded and identifying the root cause.

3. **Accountability, Non-repudiation:**
   - **Meaning:** Accountability and non-repudiation ensure that actions or events can be attributed to a specific entity and cannot be denied by that entity.
   - **Explanation:** 
     - **Accountability:** The secure record should establish accountability by clearly indicating who performed certain actions or triggered specific events. This is crucial for holding individuals or entities responsible for their actions.
     - **Non-repudiation:** Non-repudiation ensures that the originator of a message or action cannot deny their involvement. It prevents individuals from later denying that they were responsible for a particular activity.

In summary, a secure record with detection, traceability, and accountability/non-repudiation capabilities provides a comprehensive and reliable account of security-related events. It helps in identifying, understanding, and attributing actions within a system, contributing to effective security management and incident response.

**1. ENS (CCN-STIC-815):** Refers to the "Esquema Nacional de Seguridad," a cybersecurity framework in Spain.

**2. Types of Metrics:**
   - **Effectiveness Indicators:** Measure performance by comparing incident records to assess how events were handled. A poor result may indicate late discovery of events and issues with preventive measures.
   - **Impact Indicators:** Measure the effect of technical incidents on the final mission of the system, without including technical details. These indicators inform decision-making in the governance department.
   - **Compliance Metrics:** Measure whether formal requirements have been met or if preventive measures have been taken. A positive result indicates that the system is better prepared to face attacks or incidents, even though it doesn't guarantee overall success.

**3. Categories of Metrics and Indicators:**
   - **Predictive Metrics/Indicators:** Anticipate security issues, allowing for the creation of dynamic protection measures that adapt to the situation.
   - **Explanatory Metrics/Indicators:** Provide insight into past events, helping understand what happened and enabling informed action.

In summary, the focus is on assessing the performance, impact, and compliance of cybersecurity measures, using various types of indicators and metrics within the framework of ENS (CCN-STIC-815), with compliance metrics now included under the types of metrics.
